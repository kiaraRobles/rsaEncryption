# rsaEncryption

This repository is to catalog an attempt to implement an RSA encoder and decoder in Objective-C++.


#####  Considerations for improvements
- Maxamize the number of immutable objects (can't change them in any way)
- Make ojects un-protypable (can't copy or "subclass" them)
- Make properties read-only
- Make properties that can be made private (only the object itself can use them)
